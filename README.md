# Smart-Attendance-Managemnet-System-Using-Python
The main intention of this project is to solve the issues encountered in the old attendance system while reproducing a brand new innovative smart system that can provide convenience to the institution. In this project, an application will be developed which is capable of recognising the identity of each individual and eventually record down the data into a database system. ● The targeted groups of the attendance monitoring system are the students and staff of an educational institution. ● The database of the attendance management system can hold up to 2000 individual’s information. ● The facial recognition process can only be done for 1 person at a time. ● The project has to work under a Wi-Fi coverage area or under Ethernet connection, as the system needs to update the database of the attendance system constantly. ● The device on which the application is running is powered up by a power bank to improve the portability of the application. ● The higher the megapixel count on a camera sensor, the greater amount of detail that can be captured in a picture. The recognition will be quicker and more accurate.
